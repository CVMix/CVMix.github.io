<p>This is just a placeholder webpage made on January 31, 2014. This needs to be replaced sometime in February.</p>

<p>It should point to things like <a href="https://github.com/CVMix/CVMix-description/raw/master/cvmix.pdf">Steve's scientific description</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CVMix/CVMix-src/raw/master/doc/protex_documentation.pdf">the protex documentation</a>.</p>

<p>It should also mention that CVMix can be downloaded from <a href="CVMix-src/">here</a>.
